# Large-int-adder

## Description
This C++ program adds two large integers that are input by the user. It is designed to handle integers larger than those typically managed by standard data types, up to a maximum of 25 digits.

## Features
- **Large Number Handling:** Capable of processing numbers up to 25 digits long.
- **Input Validation:** Checks for valid numeric input and handles non-numeric characters gracefully.
- **Overflow Detection:** Detects and reports integer overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum size.

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program:** Use a C++ compiler to compile the program. For example, if using GCC, you can compile with `g++ -o LargeIntegerAddition main.cpp`.
2. **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled program. During execution, you will be prompted to enter two large integers.
3. **View the Result:** After entering the numbers, the program will display the sum or report an overflow error if applicable.

## Installation
Clone this repository or download the source code to your local machine. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed to compile and run the program.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/large-integer-addition.git
cd large-integer-addition
g++ -o LargeIntegerAddition main.cpp
./LargeIntegerAddition
```
